# Build a macOS VisionVNC app, install it to /Applications, and restart it —
# quitting the running copy first and relaunching the freshly installed one. For
# a fast local rebuild-test loop: TCC permissions (Accessibility, Screen/Audio
# Recording, Automation) and the stored token live with the app in
# /Applications, not with Xcode's DerivedData build, so running the installed
# copy is what you actually test.
#
# Builds the small menu-bar **companion** by default, or the **full** macOS app
# (VisionVNCMac — full client + companion host features) when passed "full".
#
# Usage:   scripts/install-companion.sh [companion|full]   (default: companion)
#   companion  the lightweight menu-bar host app (MIT)
#   full       the full VisionVNCMac client+host app (links Moonlight → GPLv3;
#              runs scripts/setup-deps.sh first to fetch the real dependencies)
#
# Why signing matters here: macOS ties TCC privacy grants (Accessibility,
# Screen/Audio Recording, Automation) to the app's code-signing identity. An
# ad-hoc signature ("-") gets a fresh, unstable cdhash on every build, so each
# rebuild looks like a brand-new app and macOS silently drops every grant — you
# re-approve all the prompts after every install. Signing with your stable Apple
# Development identity (the one Xcode already provisions for this Mac) keeps the
# signing identity constant across rebuilds, so the grants stick.
#
# By default this script auto-detects your "Apple Development" identity from the
# login keychain and signs with it. If none is found it falls back to ad-hoc and
# warns. Override detection with SIGN_IDENTITY (e.g. SIGN_IDENTITY="-" to force
# ad-hoc, or a specific identity name / 40-char SHA-1 hash).
#
# Options (env):
#   CONFIG=Debug          build configuration (default: Release)
#   SIGN_IDENTITY="…"     codesign identity. Default: auto-detected Apple
#                         Development identity (falls back to "-", ad-hoc).
#                         Pass "-" to force ad-hoc, or a name/hash to pin one.
#
# Note: the companion's bundle id is com.illixion.VisionVNCCompanion. After the
# rename from "Audio Sender" (a different bundle id), macOS treats this as a new
# app — re-grant permissions on first launch and re-pair the token.

# Which app to build/install: the small menu-bar "companion" (default), or the
# "full" macOS app (VisionVNCMac — the VNC/Moonlight/Audio/SSH client *plus* the
# companion host features in one app). The full app links Moonlight (GPLv3), so
# it needs the real dependencies cloned/patched into repos/ first (setup-deps.sh).
